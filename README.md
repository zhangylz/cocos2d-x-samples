## How To Create New Samples

### 1、init environment

	$ python download-engine.py

	$ cd libs/cocos2d-x

	$ python setup.py

### 2、create new sample

	$ cd samples

	$ cocos new ProjectName -l [cpp or js or lua] 

**attension: only create projectName in samples dir, it will be compiled correctly**
